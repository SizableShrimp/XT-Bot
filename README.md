# XT-Bot
A Java Discord bot made with the Discord4J library. (Not intended for use by others.)

This version is made using Discord4J version 2.10.2-SNAPSHOT which is not the latest (v3). v3 brings a completely new paradigm shift with functional programming because Project Reactor is used as a basis of v3 which is better in design than v2. This branch is not recommended AT ALL because of the Discord4J version and my bad coding when I made it.
