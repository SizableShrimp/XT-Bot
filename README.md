# XT-Bot
A Java Discord bot made with the Discord4J library.

This bot can play music, check Fortnite stats, change nicknames with generated names, say hello, display statistics of a YouTube channel, and has an amazing help system! This bot uses Discord4J v3 which utilizes Project Reactor to wrap items in Monos and Fluxes which may be requested from Discord and take time to be received. Reactive programming uses the functional paradigm and the Discord4J along with this codebase also uses reactor to its fullest extent reactively to utilize resources. This allows a bot like this to run with only megabytes of memory even with thousands of guilds and multiple shards. Feel free to fork your own version or PR features.
